            Example:
        </h3>
        <p>
            In this example, there is an array of rainfall measurements in JavaScript. The array is looped over to calculate the total and average. Negative numbers are considered invalid and not included through the use of an if statement. The results are displayed back to the user in the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Read the comments in the JavaScript code to understand the steps involved. 
        </p>

        <div id="example">

            <br>
            <button id="runExample">
                Run example
            </button>

            <div id="displayExample">

                <ul id="rainfallList">

        <h3>
            Exercise one:
        </h3>

        <p>
            Within the runExercise() function in the JavaScript file, you will see two arrays: languages and descriptions. You should loop through these arrays to display them on the screen so that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each language from the languages array is displayed within an h3 element</li>
            <li>The description for each language is displayed below the matching h3 element within a paragraph element</li>
            <li>When complete, each language should display with the title as an h3 and description as a paragraph directly below</li>
            <li>You can display the content within the div with the id 'displayExercise'</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Suggested steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get required references for any HTML elements you may wish to add content to</li>
            <li>Loop through the languages array with a traditional for Loop</li>
            <li>For each iteration of the loop, use the 'innerHTML' property of the parent div with '+=' to add the required h3 and paragraph elements to the page with the appropriate data from the arrays nested inside each element</li>
            <li>If you are unsure of any steps, check the code in the example as it is relatively similar</li>
            <li>Remember that you can use the 'i' value within a for loop to access the item in that index of a matching array and the languages and descriptions content match each other</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="exercise">

            <br>
            <button id="runExercise">
                Run exercise
            </button>
            <br><br>
            <div id="displayExercise">Display exercise: </div>
            
        </div>

        <h3>
            Exercise two:
        </h3>

        <p>
            You will see that inside the runExerciseTwo() function, there are a series of arrays: emotions, adjectives, nouns, verbs, adverbs, locations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For this exercise, you will use the arrays provided to create a random poem generator. When the user clicks the 'Run exercise two' button a random poem should be generated by selecting one word from each array and concatenating/adding it into a poem template you create.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example poem could be: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                [emotion] is like a [adjective] [noun] [verb] [adverb] [location].
            </li>
            <li>
                anger is like a bewildered goldfish shivering elegantly behind the refridgerator.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You will need to investigate how to generate random numbers and generate a random number between 0 and the last item of each array to select a random item from each array. Try to write your code so that it automatically adapts to whatever size each array is and won't break if items are added or removed from any array.
        </p>
        <p>
            For extension you can try to add a few more arrays of different types of words to extend the poem. Try to be creative. Alternatively, you could try to create a random rock song generator or anything else that builds upon the same concept.
